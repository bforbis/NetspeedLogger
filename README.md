# NetspeedLogger

I've grown tired of my internet connection being very slow, especially when Comcast presumably is giving me a 150 Mbit/s connection.

The NetspeedLogger is a python script that will perform speedtest checks against www.speedtest.net and log the results to a designated logfile. It can easily be setup to run every 30 minutes in a user's crontab.

Currently, NetspeedLogger only works on Macs. I intend for this to eventually be cross-platform
